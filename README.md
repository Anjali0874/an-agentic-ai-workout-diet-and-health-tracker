# An agentic ai workout, diet and health tracker

This project involves developing an agentic AI system that provides personalized workout and diet recommendations to users, tracks their progress, and offers insights into their overall health. The system will leverage machine learning models to analyze user data, including workout logs, dietary intake, and health metrics (e.g., weight, sleep patterns), to generate tailored recommendations. The agentic nature of the AI implies autonomous decision-making within predefined constraints, such as adjusting workout difficulty based on user performance or suggesting alternative meal plans based on dietary restrictions. The system will be designed with a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction and data input.

The project aims to explore the application of AI in personalized health management, focusing on the design and implementation of an intelligent agent capable of adapting to individual user needs and providing actionable insights. Students will gain hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning model development, and software engineering. The project will also emphasize ethical considerations related to data privacy and algorithm transparency in the context of health-related applications.

Successful completion of this project requires a strong understanding of AI principles, data science techniques, and software development methodologies. Students will collaborate as a team to design, implement, and evaluate the AI-powered health tracker, demonstrating their ability to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world problem.
